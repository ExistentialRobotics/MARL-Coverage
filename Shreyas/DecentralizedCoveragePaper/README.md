# DecentralizedCoverage

Multi Agent algorithm working when agents know true sensing function:

The agents are clustering around the areas where the sesning function is higher, (2,6) and (6,2)

Todos: 
- ~~Fix parameter update (add projection step to prevent numerical errors)~~
- Vectorizes stuff to make it faster
- Improve the visualization to show the sensing function(translucent background)
- Figure out why parameters are always trying to got to zero
